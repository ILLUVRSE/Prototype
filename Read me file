# ILLUVRSE / Prototype

Welcome to the **ILLUVRSE Prototype Repository** — a sandbox for testing and iterating on early-stage concepts, mechanics, and systems that may become part of the ILLUVIUM universe.

> 🚧 This repository contains experimental code and is **not production-ready**. Expect rapid iteration, breaking changes, and evolving documentation.

---

## 🌌 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to explore and validate prototype ideas that support the growth of the ILLUVRSE experience across gameplay, infrastructure, and user interfaces.

We focus on:
- New game mechanics (e.g., traversal, interaction systems, mini-games)
- UI/UX concepts for web3 onboarding
- Backend services for simulation or real-time logic
- Integration tests with NFTs, wallets, or marketplace logic
- AR/VR and mixed reality experimentation
