# ILLUVRSE Prototype

This repository provides a minimal prototype for the ILLUVRSE project.
It includes a Node.js backend written in TypeScript and a React frontend
also using TypeScript. Authentication and data storage rely on Supabase.

## Structure

- `backend/` – Express API with routes for authentication, user profiles, and missions.
- `frontend/` – Vite + React application with pages for login, profile management, and missions.

Both folders contain their own `package.json` with the dependencies required.
Note that dependencies are **not installed** in this environment.
